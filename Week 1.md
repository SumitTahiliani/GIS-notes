#### Vector data terminology
Vertex or node is a point that specifies a position on a line for arcs, polylines or polygons. A point in GIS is considered to be a 0-dimensional vector entity

Points are normally used to represent a geographic feature too small to be displayed as a line or area. e.g. roorkee within india will be a point due to relative sizing. If a map of haridwar is displayed then roorkee is a polygon/area 0 -> 2 dimensional entity.

Coordinates in vector data are provided in geographical format (latitude/longitude) however some point features (e.g. airplane locations) might also have a Z coordinate to locate in 3D space.
