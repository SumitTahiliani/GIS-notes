### Non Spatial Data

Six kinds of basic attributes are used in GIS:

#### Nominal/Categories
Simple type of attribute, described by name and to identify or distinguish one entity from another, with no specific order. Examples include: Categories of landuse and forest, Place names, Names of houses etc.

Categories are groups of similar things that help organize the data. All features with teh same value for a category are alike in some way, and different from features with other values for that category.

Each attribute only serves to identify the particular instance of a class of entities from other members of the same class. Includes numbers, letters and colors.

#### Ordinal/Ranks
List of discrete classes with an inherent/natural order sequence

Ranks put features in order (high to low). Also used when direct measures are difficult or the quantity represents a combination of factors

Since ranks are relative, we can only see where a feature falls in the order and not how much higher/lower it is compared to another value 

Eg. Rating agricultural land by classes of soil quality (class1, class2 etc.)

#### Interval
Attributes have natural sequence and the distance between values has a meaning.

eg. pH scale has a meaning. Celsius temperature scale is also an interval

#### Ratio
Same characteristics as interval variables but additionally have a zero or starting point.

eg. rainfall per month, weight (100kg is twice as heavy as 50kg)

#### Cyclic
Directional or cyclic data
The number after 359 is 0 

Averaging two directions such as 359 and 1 gives 180, so average of two directions close to north can appear 180 which is south
#### Counts and Amounts
Show total number, count is the actual number of features on the map.

AN amount can be any measurable quantity associated with a feature. Lets us see the actual value of each feature as well as its magnitude compared to other features.
